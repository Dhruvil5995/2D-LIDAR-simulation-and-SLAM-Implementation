# 2D LIDAR Simulation and SLAM Implementation in Python

Welcome to the repository where we tackle the intricacies of robotic perception through a robust line segment extraction algorithm coupled with SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). Our focus here is on leveraging laser data and implementing a seeded region growing algorithm to discern line segments even in the presence of noise. This forms a foundational component for robotic applications requiring high levels of mapping, navigation precision, and object recognition.

## Project Overview

The core of this project is the `Line Segment Extraction Algorithm`, which processes laser scan data to identify and extract line segments that are critical for robotic perception tasks. We've developed a simulated 2D LIDAR sensor system that uses our custom `LaserSensors` class. This class is responsible for calculating distances to obstacles and sensing the environment, introducing a controlled level of uncertainty to mimic real-world conditions.

Our `featuresDetection` class is the heart of the SLAM algorithm, processing sensor data to pinpoint and delineate environmental features. It employs a suite of methods for computations such as line fitting with the Orthogonal Distance Regression (ODR) method and managing seed segments for the growing process.

We harness the power of the Pygame library to visually simulate sensor data collection and feature detection in a mapped environment. Through an interactive display, users can witness the SLAM algorithm in action, as it collects data, processes it, and identifies features on the map.

### Features at a Glance

- Robust line segment extraction from noisy laser data using seeded region growing.
- Efficient handling of environmental clutter to deliver reliable detections.

# 2D LIDAR simulation and SLAM Implementation using Python<br>
This repository contains an implementation of a line segment extraction algorithm that utilizes laser data and seeded region growing. The algorithm is designed to robustly detect line segments in noisy environments, enabling accurate perception and decision-making for robotic applications such as mapping, navigation, and object detection.<br>


**Line Segment Extraction Algorithm using Laser Data and Seeded Region Growing**<br>



Development of a 2D LIDAR sensor and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithm to detect features from the sensor data. The sensor is simulated using the LaserSensors class, which has methods to calculate the distance between the sensor and an obstacle, and sense obstacles in the environment. The sensor adds uncertainty to the sensor data using the uncertainty_add function. <br>

The SLAM algorithm is implemented using the featuresDetection class which has several methods that process the sensor data and detect features in the environment. The methods include distance calculation between points and lines, line-fitting, and point projection. The class also has methods for converting between different line representation and for detecting and growing seed segments. <br>

The simulation is run using Pygame library, which is used to display the sensor data and detected features on the map of the environment. The simulation starts by initializing the environment, sensor, and feature detection classes. The sensor data is collected by moving a cursor on the screen, which simulates the movement of the robot. The sensor data is then processed by the SLAM algorithm, and features are detected and displayed on the map of the environment. <br>

The simulation was implemented using Pygame library which provides an interactive and visual way to display the sensor data and detected features. <br>
